## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- `NgxEditorJSService` is now provided in the root and now stores multiple editor instances. Getters removed and replaced with methods that take the `holder` parameter which is the ID of the DOM element the editor should be attached to.
- Plugins are now instances of an `Injectable` class for AOT and have an instance method of `plugin`. Also supports `shortcut` as an optional method that returns the string to set up as the shortcut.

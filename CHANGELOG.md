The first devlog is to report that currently `version 1.2` has been delayed due to current build issues.
A [bug report has been filed](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/1077) on `@nrwl/nx` project.

In 1.2 there is a new [`@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins) module that provides exports for several common `EditorJS` plugins and will be expanded to cover all the officially released plugins.

With this change the current build scripts break, and until it is resolved this will block the release.

In the meantime I'll continue to work on this small demo site, making it more useful as a good example of an Angular app.

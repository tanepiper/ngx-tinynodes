             This handles the management of  EditorJS instances and their lifecycle.\nAll EditorJS instances are created outside of Angular using  NgZone  to ensure change detection is not triggered.\nOnce an instance is created, several  Observable values are also set up:\n\n isReady  Set when the editor instance is ready in the DOM\n hasSaved  Set when the editor .save() method has been called.\n lastChange  Set when a change happens, contains the OutputData from the Editor.\n\nAfter setup,  isReady  is set to true and the editor can be used within Angular.  There are some methods provided\nfor  save ,  update  and  clear  - and an  apiCall  method which allows\nfor any call to be made to EditorJS that matches it's API.\n\n            \n\n\n\n

\n\nTinynodes Changelog\n\nThis changelog is related to the overall site. You can also find changelogs for libraries under the library docs\n\n\nUNRELEASED\nToday @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@3.0.0 has been released, along with @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins@2.0.0\nThe plugin architecture of the components has been re-written so that plugins are just NgModule classes\nthat provide multi providers for injecting plugins and their configuration.  These are merged into a map\nthat the NgxEditorJSPluginService now provides, and provides methods to getting tool options for instances.\nThis means the plugin module is now a dependency of the project.\nInternally there is some tidy-up related to this, and better async/await handling of the instance creation\nalong with API calls.  The Material demo \nhas been updated as well with improvements on using the component in an application.\nWednesday, 22nd May 2019\nToday @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@2.0.0 has been released. The major bump is due to underlying changes that may be breaking - the entire service has been improved with better control over the EditorJS interface. Also in this release the exiting component has been upgraded to work with Angular Forms, and there is a new Material Form Field component provided too.\nThe demo has also been updated to reflect the new features of this, and a new demo added for the Material component.\nWednesday, 15th May 2019\nToday I have released @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@1.3.2. This will be without a Forms component. In this release the main change is internally I'm using a new EditorJS Injector module I've created to handle managing the underlying instance. There are also a lot of documentation improvements and a completly new updated demo site.\nMonday, 13th May 2019\nToday I have released @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@1.2.0. For now I've removed any default plugins from core package, now all plugins must be added at the application level - this can be see in the demo app.\nSunday, 12th May 2019\nThe first devlog is to report that currently version 1.2 has been delayed due to current build issues.\nA bug report has been filed on @nrwl/nx project.\nIn 1.2 there is a new @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins module that provides exports for several common EditorJS plugins and will be expanded to cover all the officially released plugins.\nWith this change the current build scripts break, and until it is resolved this will block the release.\nIn the meantime I'll continue to work on this small demo site, making it more useful as a good example of an Angular app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\nContributing\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,\nemail, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.\nPlease note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\nPull Request Process\n\nEnsure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a\nbuild.\nUpdate the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment\nvariables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\nIncrease the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this\nPull Request would represent.

find:\n\nNgxEditorJSDirective - An Angular Directive used to attach an EditorJS instance to any block DOM element\nNgxEditorJSComponent - An out-of-the-box Angular component that is Reactive Forms compatible\nNgxEditorJSMaterialFieldComponent An Angular Material Form Field component that provides all the required properties and life-cycle events required. See the Form Demo on an example usage\nNgxEditorJSBaseComponent - A base Angular component that is Reactive form compatible but with no template, can be used to create custom UI framework containers\nNgxEditorJSService - A Service that can be injected into an application to provide a interface to interact with EditorJS instances and manage plugins.\n\nWithin these components you will be able to access the underlying EditorJS instance, for use see the EditorJS API Docs\nYou can see a demo in action or download it\non GitHub to see how it was implemented.\nFor changes see the CHANGELOG\nInstalling and usage\nInstall the library via npm along with the plugins module and EditorJS module. For each plugin you want to use you also need to install it's dependency - see the Plugin Docs for more information.\n```bash\n\nnpm install @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins @editorjs/editorjs @editorjs/paragraph....\n```\n\nOnce installed, include the NgxEditorJSModule module in your project with the forRoot method. The forRoot takes an optional configuration.\nYou also need to pass a provider for UserPlugins with a factory function that returns an options map tools to provide to the EditorJS instance. An example of this is shows in the demo application\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgxEditorJSModule } from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    NgxEditorJSModule.forRoot({\n      // Optional Configuration, see all keys below\n      editorjs: {\n        autofocus: false,\n        holder: 'editor',\n        initialBlock: 'paragraph',\n        data: {\n          time: Date.now(),\n          version: EditorJS.version,\n          blocks: []\n        }\n      }\n    }),\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\nConfiguration\nEditorJS Config\nThe configuration is deigned to be extendable in the future, so each potential feature has a key. For configuring EditorJS pass the options below into a editorjs key in the config.\nThe module configuration allows EditorJS to be provided with a set of options for use. See the EditorJS docs for more details.\n| Configuration Key  | Description                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| autofocus        | Sets the EditorJS instance to autofocus on load                                                                                                                 |\n| autosave         | Value of time for the the autosave of EditorJS content to the service when the component when focused, this is used for Reactive forms.

These are used within NgxEditorJS to set the plugins\navailable within the editor. The plugin service is provided separably to avoid circular dependencies\nwithin the libraries and is required by @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs\nCreating a Plugin.\nCreating a plugin is very simple, the module provides some Injection Tokens for use with the module.\nThe plugin you want to import should conform to the Block or Inline format of EditorJS, alongside a configuration object that provides details about the plugin.\nBoth these providers must be set to multi: true - when the plugin service is initialised it will be provided a map of these.\nHere is an example of the PluginParagraph:\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { EDITOR_JS_TOOL_INJECTOR, PLUGIN_CONFIG, PluginTypes from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins';\nimport Paragraph from '@editorjs/paragraph';\n@NgModule({\n  providers: [{\n    provide: EDITOR_JS_TOOL_INJECTOR,\n    useValue: Paragraph,\n    multi: true // IMPORTANT!\n  }, {\n    provide: PLUGIN_CONFIG,\n    useValue: {\n      key: 'paragraph',\n      type: PluginTypes.Block,\n      pluginName: 'EditorJS Paragraph',\n    },\n    multi: true // IMPORTANT!\n  }]\n})\nexport class PluginParagraphModule {}\n```\nThe full configuration object parameters are listed below, please note some are not yet implemented in the application\nbut will be used in future releases.\n| Param Name    | Type     | Optional | Description                                                      |\n| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| key         | string | No       | The default key of the plugin (e.g. paragraph)                 |\n| type        | string | No       | The type of plugin, currently block and inline are supported |\n| pluginName  | string | No       | The descriptive name of the plugin                               |\n| shortcut    | string | Yes      | An optional keyboard shortcut for the plugin                     |\n| description | string | Yes      | A description of the plugin                                      |\n| blockData   | string | Yes      | Optional default block data to use for the plugin                |\nOnce imported into an application or module the plugin is available in the app with several methods to get plugins on the service.\n\ngetPlugins - Get a map of all plugins\ngetPlugin(key: string) - Get a specific plugin by map key\ngetPluginsWithExclude(excludeList: string[]) - Get a map of plugins but exclude ones in the passed list\ngetPluginsWithInclude(includeList: string[]) - Get a map of plugins but only the ones in the include list\n\nPeer Dependencies\nAll EditorJS plugins are listed as peerDependencies of the project - this is because Angular requires these modules to be in the root. You must manually install these are the root of your Angular application.\n```bash\n\nnpm install @editorjs/paragraph @editorjs/header ....\n```\n\nPlugin List\n| Plugin Name             | Description                                            | Links                                                                                               |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| PluginCodeModule        | Provides a  block editor                       | README GitHub              |\n| PluginHeaderModule      | Provides a  -  block editor                  | README GitHub          |\n| PluginImageModule       | Provides an  block editor + file upload support | README GitHub            |\n| PluginLinkModule        | Provides an  block editor                         | README GitHub              |\n| PluginIListModule       | Provides an / block editor                   | README GitHub              |\n| PluginMarkerModule      | Provides inline text marking                           | README GitHub          |\n| PluginParagraphModule   | Provides an  block editor                         | README GitHub    |\n| PluginSimpleImageModule | Provides an  block editor with paste support    | README GitHub |\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-plugins-readme/ngx-editorjs-plugins-changelog.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-plugins-readme/ngx-editorjs-plugins-changelog.html","title":"additional-page - ngx-editorjs-plugins Changelog","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog,\nand this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n[2.0.1] 2019-05-06\nChanged\n\nThere is a known issue since upgrading to Angular 8 with the EditorJS Header Module.\nThis causes the Header module to fail rendering when data is passed to it on initial setup.  The Header itself still works\nwhen added via the block toolbar. A temporary fix has been provided in the module by extending the Header\nand fixing the method.\nFixed peerDependencies\n\n[2.0.0] 2019-05-05\nAdded\n\nNgxEditorJSPluginService returns to the plugin module as a requirement to avoid circular dependencies.\nThis service now provides a more reliable way of handling plugins, each plugin is a module with two multi providers\nwhich are turned into a configuration map of plugins.\n\nChanged\n\nPlugins no longer provide an injectable class, all plugins are modules that provide\ninjectable EDITOR_JS_TOOL_INJECTOR and PLUGIN_CONFIG. These provides are injected in the\nplugin service and made available in the editor. See the README for details on how\nplugins are created\n\n[1.1.1] - 2019-05-15\nChanged\n\nDocumentation updates\n\n[1.1.0] - 2019-05-13\nRemoved\n\nRemoved the NgxEditorJSPluginService from this module back to core\n\n[1.0.0] - 2019-05-11\nAdded\n\nInitial release of module with default plugins - see README.md for details.\nMoved the internal PluginService to public NgxEditorJSPluginService provided by this module\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}

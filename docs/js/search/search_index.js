You can also find changelogs for libraries under the library docs\n\n\nMonday, 13th May 2019\nToday I have released @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@1.2.0. For now I've removed any default plugins from core package, now all plugins must be added at the application level - this can be see in the demo app.\nSunday, 12th May 2019\nThe first devlog is to report that currently version 1.2 has been delayed due to current build issues.\nA bug report has been filed on @nrwl/nx project.\nIn 1.2 there is a new @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins module that provides exports for several common EditorJS plugins and will be expanded to cover all the officially released plugins.\nWith this change the current build scripts break, and until it is resolved this will block the release.\nIn the meantime I'll continue to work on this small demo site, making it more useful as a good example of an Angular app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\nContributing\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,\nemail, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.\nPlease note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\nPull Request Process\n\nEnsure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a\nbuild.\nUpdate the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment\nvariables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\nIncrease the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this\nPull Request would represent.

can see a demo in action or download it\non GitHub to see how it was implemented.\nFor changes see the CHANGELOG\nInstalling and usage\nInstall the library via npm:\n```bash\n\nnpm install @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins\n```\n\nOnce installed, include the NgxEditorJSModule module in your project with the forRoot method. The forRoot takes an optional configuration.\nYou also need to pass a provider for UserPlugins with a factory function that returns an options map tools to provide to the EditorJS instance. An example of this is shows in the demo application\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgxEditorJSModule } from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport EditorJS from '@editorjs/editorjs';\nimport {\n  PluginParagraphModule,\n  PluginParagraph,\n  PluginHeaderModule,\n  PluginHeader,\n  PluginListModule,\n  PluginList\n} from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins';\nexport function createTools() {\n  return {\n    paragraph: new PluginParagraph(),\n    header: new PluginHeader(),\n    list: new PluginList()\n  };\n}\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    NgxEditorJSModule.forRoot({\n      editorjs: {\n        autofocus: false,\n        holder: 'editor',\n        initialBlock: 'paragraph',\n        data: {\n          time: Date.now(),\n          version: EditorJS.version,\n          blocks: []\n        }\n      }\n    })\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: UserPlugins,\n      useFactory: createTools\n    }\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\nConfiguration\nEditorJS Config\nThe configuration is deigned to be extendable in the future, so each potential feature has a key. For configuring EditorJS pass the options below into a editorjs key in the config.\nThe module configuration allows EditorJS to be provided with a set of options for use. See the EditorJS docs for more details.\n| Configuration Key | Description                                                                                       |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| autofocus       | Sets the EditorJS instance to autofocus on load                                                   |\n| data            | Initial data to load into the editor, this is an OutputData object from EditorJS                |\n| hideToolbar     | Hides the toolbar by default                                                                      |\n| holder          | The element ID of the holder, this will set all instances in this module to use this as a default |\n| initialBlock    | The default block type to use in the editor                                                       |\n| minHeight       | Height of Editor's bottom area that allows to set focus on the last Block                         |\n| placeholder     | Placeholder of the first block                                                                    |\n| sanitizer       | Content sanitizer configurations                                                                  |\nAdding custom tools\nTo include tools in an Angular AOT-friendly way, inside your project, create a folder for your plugin and add an Injectable class with a plugin() method, and optional shortcut method for features that support it.\n```ts\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ToolSettings } from '@editorjs/editorjs';\nimport Marker from '@editorjs/marker';\nimport { BasePlugin } from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs';\n@Injectable()\nexport class PluginMarker implements BasePlugin {\n  plugin(): ToolSettings {\n    return Marker;\n  }\n  shortcut(): string {\n    return 'SHIFT+CTRL+M';\n  }\n}\n```\nThis allows Angular's AOT to include the editor component bundled within the application. Then export this via a module:\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { PluginMarker } from './marker.plugin';\n@NgModule({\n  providers: [PluginMarker]\n})\nexport class PluginMarkerModule {}\n```\nOnce you have created all your required modules, inside your Application or Feature module you need to provide an instance of UserPlugins using a factory function. Inside your module you can now add the following:\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NgxEditorJSModule, UserPlugins, PluginConfig } from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs';\nimport { PluginMarkerModule } from './plugins/marker/marker.module';\nimport { PluginMarker } from '../plugins/marker/marker.plugin';\nexport function createTools(): PluginConfig {\n  return {\n    code: new PluginCode()\n  };\n}\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [NgxEditorJSModule, PluginMarker],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: UserPlugins,\n      useFactory: createTools\n    }\n  ],\n  exports: [PluginMarker]\n})\nexport class CustomModule {}\n```\nWhat's in the library\nNgxEditorJSDirective\nThis is the main directive which can be used on any element with the [ngxEditorJS]. It has one input which is blocks and this takes an array of EditorJS blocks.\nNgxEditorJSComponent\nThis component can be used in any Angular component using the  tag. Again this component can take a set of blocks, it also provides a holder input for overriding the ID.\nNgxEditorJSService\nThis service provides handling the life-cycle of the EditorJS instance, and exposes the underlying EditorJS instance.API - in future releases more of the API will be exposed via service methods to make controlling the container easier.\nLinks\n\nDocumentation\nGitHub\nNPM\nAngular Demo\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-readme/ngx-editorjs-changelog.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-readme/ngx-editorjs-changelog.html","title":"additional-page - ngx-editorjs Changelog","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog,\nand this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n[1.2.0] - 2019-05-13\nAdded\n\nAdded all configuration options for EditorJS to the module configuration\n\nChanged\n\nRemoved all plugins from the ngx-editorjs project.

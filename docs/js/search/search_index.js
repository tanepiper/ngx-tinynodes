EditorJS instances and their lifecycle.\nAll EditorJS instances are created outside of Angular using  NgZone  to ensure change detection is not triggered.\nOnce an instance is created, several  Observable values are also set up:\n\n isReady  Set when the editor instance is ready in the DOM\n hasSaved  Set when the editor .save() method has been called.\n lastChange  Set when a change happens, contains the OutputData from the Editor.\n\nAfter setup,  isReady  is set to true and the editor can be used within Angular.  There are some methods provided\nfor  save ,  update  and  clear  - and an  apiCall  method which allows\nfor any call to be made to EditorJS that matches it's API.\n\n            \n\n\n\n

changelog is related to the overall site. You can also find changelogs for libraries under the library docs\n\n\nUNRELEASED\nToday @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@3.0.0 has been released, along with @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins@2.0.0\nThe plugin architecture of the components has been re-written so that plugins are just NgModule classes\nthat provide multi providers for injecting plugins and their configuration.  These are merged into a map\nthat the NgxEditorJSPluginService now provides, and provides methods to getting tool options for instances.\nThis means the plugin module is now a dependency of the project.\nInternally there is some tidy-up related to this, and better async/await handling of the instance creation\nalong with API calls.  The Material demo \nhas been updated as well with improvements on using the component in an application.\nWednesday, 22nd May 2019\nToday @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@2.0.0 has been released. The major bump is due to underlying changes that may be breaking - the entire service has been improved with better control over the EditorJS interface. Also in this release the exiting component has been upgraded to work with Angular Forms, and there is a new Material Form Field component provided too.\nThe demo has also been updated to reflect the new features of this, and a new demo added for the Material component.\nWednesday, 15th May 2019\nToday I have released @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@1.3.2. This will be without a Forms component. In this release the main change is internally I'm using a new EditorJS Injector module I've created to handle managing the underlying instance. There are also a lot of documentation improvements and a completly new updated demo site.\nMonday, 13th May 2019\nToday I have released @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@1.2.0. For now I've removed any default plugins from core package, now all plugins must be added at the application level - this can be see in the demo app.\nSunday, 12th May 2019\nThe first devlog is to report that currently version 1.2 has been delayed due to current build issues.\nA bug report has been filed on @nrwl/nx project.\nIn 1.2 there is a new @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins module that provides exports for several common EditorJS plugins and will be expanded to cover all the officially released plugins.\nWith this change the current build scripts break, and until it is resolved this will block the release.\nIn the meantime I'll continue to work on this small demo site, making it more useful as a good example of an Angular app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\nContributing\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,\nemail, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.\nPlease note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\nPull Request Process\n\nEnsure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a\nbuild.\nUpdate the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment\nvariables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\nIncrease the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this\nPull Request would represent.

Inside the module you will find:\n\nNgxEditorJSDirective - An Angular Directive used to attach an EditorJS instance to any block DOM element\nNgxEditorJSComponent - An out-of-the-box Angular component that is Reactive Forms compatible\nNgxEditorJSMaterialFieldComponent An Angular Material Form Field component that provides all the required properties and life-cycle events required. See the Form Demo on an example usage\nNgxEditorJSService - A Service that can be injected into an application to provide a interface to interact with EditorJS instances. Underneath are the private NgxEditorJSPluginService and NgxEditorJSInstanceService services. These are private but can be imported via ɵNgxEditorJSPluginService and ɵNgxEditorJSInstanceService from the library if you want to use them.\n\nWithin these components you will be able to access the underlying EditorJS instance, for use see the EditorJS API Docs\nBelow are the dependencies to use the features.\n@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs\nThis project provides a set of features for using EditorJS within Angular 7+\n\nReadme\nChangelog\nDemo\nProject Folder\n\n@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins\nThis project provides the plugin service module that exports handles\n plugins for @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs.

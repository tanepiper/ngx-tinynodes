You can also find changelogs for libraries under the library docs\n\n\nWednesday, 22nd May 2019\nToday @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@2.0.0 has been released. The major bump is due to underlying changes that may be breaking - the entire service has been improved with better control over the EditorJS interface. Also in this release the exiting component has been upgraded to work with Angular Forms, and there is a new Material Form Field component provided too.\nThe demo has also been updated to reflect the new features of this, and a new demo added for the Material component.\nWednesday, 15th May 2019\nToday I have released @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@1.3.2. This will be without a Forms component. In this release the main change is internally I'm using a new EditorJS Injector module I've created to handle managing the underlying instance. There are also a lot of documentation improvements and a completly new updated demo site.\nMonday, 13th May 2019\nToday I have released @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs@1.2.0. For now I've removed any default plugins from core package, now all plugins must be added at the application level - this can be see in the demo app.\nSunday, 12th May 2019\nThe first devlog is to report that currently version 1.2 has been delayed due to current build issues.\nA bug report has been filed on @nrwl/nx project.\nIn 1.2 there is a new @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins module that provides exports for several common EditorJS plugins and will be expanded to cover all the officially released plugins.\nWith this change the current build scripts break, and until it is resolved this will block the release.\nIn the meantime I'll continue to work on this small demo site, making it more useful as a good example of an Angular app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\nContributing\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,\nemail, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.\nPlease note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\nPull Request Process\n\nEnsure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a\nbuild.\nUpdate the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment\nvariables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\nIncrease the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this\nPull Request would represent.

Inside the module you will find:\n\nNgxEditorJSDirective - An Angular Directive used to attach an EditorJS instance to any block DOM element\nNgxEditorJSComponent - An out-of-the-box Angular component that is Reactive Forms compatible\nNgxEditorJSMaterialFieldComponent An Angular Material Form Field component that provides all the required properties and life-cycle events required. See the Form Demo on an example usage\nNgxEditorJSBaseComponent - A base Angular component that is Reactive form compatible but with no template, can be used to create custom UI framework containers\nNgxEditorJSService - A Service that can be injected into an application to provide a interface to interact with EditorJS instances. Underneath are the private NgxEditorJSPluginService and NgxEditorJSInstanceService services. These are private but can be imported via ɵNgxEditorJSPluginService and ɵNgxEditorJSInstanceService from the library if you want to use them.\n\nWithin these components you will be able to access the underlying EditorJS instance, for use see the EditorJS API Docs\nBelow are the dependencies to use the features.\n@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs\nThis project provides a set of features for using EditorJS within Angular 7+\n\nReadme\nChangelog\nDemo\nProject Folder\n\n@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins\nThis project provides a module that exports a set of default plugins for @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs.\n\nReadme\nChangelog\nProject Folder\n\nDevelopment Information\nThis repository is run by Tane Piper and was generated using Nx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nTinynodes General MIT Licence\nCopyright 2019 Tane Piper me@tane.dev\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

find:\n\nNgxEditorJSDirective - An Angular Directive used to attach an EditorJS instance to any block DOM element\nNgxEditorJSComponent - An out-of-the-box Angular component that is Reactive Forms compatible\nNgxEditorJSMaterialFieldComponent An Angular Material Form Field component that provides all the required properties and life-cycle events required. See the Form Demo on an example usage\nNgxEditorJSBaseComponent - A base Angular component that is Reactive form compatible but with no template, can be used to create custom UI framework containers\nNgxEditorJSService - A Service that can be injected into an application to provide a interface to interact with EditorJS instances and manage plugins.\n\nWithin these components you will be able to access the underlying EditorJS instance, for use see the EditorJS API Docs\nYou can see a demo in action or download it\non GitHub to see how it was implemented.\nFor changes see the CHANGELOG\nInstalling and usage\nInstall the library via npm along with the plugins module and EditorJS module. For each plugin you want to use you also need to install it's dependency - see the Plugin Docs for more information.\n```bash\n\nnpm install @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs-plugins @editorjs/editorjs @editorjs/paragraph....\n```\n\nOnce installed, include the NgxEditorJSModule module in your project with the forRoot method. The forRoot takes an optional configuration.\nYou also need to pass a provider for UserPlugins with a factory function that returns an options map tools to provide to the EditorJS instance.

For configuring EditorJS pass the options below into a editorjs key in the config.\nThe module configuration allows EditorJS to be provided with a set of options for use. See the EditorJS docs for more details.\n| Configuration Key  | Description                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| autofocus        | Sets the EditorJS instance to autofocus on load                                                                                                                 |\n| autosave         | Value of time for the the autosave of EditorJS content to the service when the component when focused, this is used for Reactive forms.

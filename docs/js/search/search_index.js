can see a demo in action or download it\non GitHub to see how it was implemented.\nFor changes see the CHANGELOG\nInstalling and usage\nInstall the library via npm:\n```bash\n\nnpm install @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs\n```\n\nOnce installed, include the NgxEditorJSModule module in your project with the forRoot method. By default the editor is pre-configured with the standard Header and List tools provided by the EditorJS Team. To overwrite existing tools or add your own see documentation on adding then via Plugin Modules.\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgxEditorJSModule } from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport EditorJS from '@editorjs/editorjs';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    NgxEditorJSModule.forRoot({\n      editorjs: {\n        autofocus: false,\n        holder: 'editor',\n        initialBlock: 'paragraph',\n        data: {\n          time: Date.now(),\n          version: EditorJS.version,\n          blocks: []\n        }\n      }\n    })\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\nConfiguration\nEditorJS Config\nThe configuration is deigned to be extendable in the future, so each potential feature has a key. For configuring EditorJS pass the options below into a editorjs key in the config.\nThe module configuration allows EditorJS to be provided with a set of options for use. See the EditorJS docs for more details.\n| Configuration Key | Description                                                                                       | Default     |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |\n| autofocus       | Sets the EditorJS instance to autofocus on load                                                   | false     |\n| holder          | The element ID of the holder, this will set all instances in this module to use this as a default | editor-js |\n| initialBlock    | The default block type to use in the editor                                                       | paragraph |\n| data            | Initial data to load into the editor, this is an OutputData object from EditorJS                | undefined |\nAdding custom tools\nTo include tools in an Angular AOT-friendly way, inside your project, create a folder for your plugin and add an Injectable class with a plugin() method, and optional shortcut method for features that support it.\n```ts\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ToolSettings } from '@editorjs/editorjs';\nimport Marker from '@editorjs/marker';\nimport { BasePlugin } from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs';\n@Injectable()\nexport class PluginMarker implements BasePlugin {\n  plugin(): ToolSettings {\n    return Marker;\n  }\n  shortcut(): string {\n    return 'SHIFT+CTRL+M';\n  }\n}\n```\nThis allows Angular's AOT to include the editor component bundled within the application. Then export this via a module:\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { PluginMarker } from './marker.plugin';\n@NgModule({\n  providers: [PluginMarker]\n})\nexport class PluginMarkerModule {}\n```\nOnce you have created all your required modules, inside your Application or Feature module you need to provide an instance of UserPlugins using a factory function. Inside your module you can now add the following:\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NgxEditorJSModule, UserPlugins, PluginConfig } from '@tinynodes/ngx-editorjs';\nimport { PluginMarkerModule } from './plugins/marker/marker.module';\nimport { PluginMarker } from '../plugins/marker/marker.plugin';\nexport function createTools(): PluginConfig {\n  return {\n    code: new PluginCode()\n  };\n}\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [NgxEditorJSModule, PluginMarker],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: UserPlugins,\n      useFactory: createTools\n    }\n  ],\n  exports: [PluginMarker]\n})\nexport class CustomModule {}\n```\nWhat's in the library\nNgxEditorJSDirective\nThis is the main directive which can be used on any element with the [ngxEditorJS]. It has one input which is blocks and this takes an array of EditorJS blocks.\nNgxEditorJSComponent\nThis component can be used in any Angular component using the  tag. Again this component can take a set of blocks, it also provides a holder input for overriding the ID.\nNgxEditorJSService\nThis service provides handling the life-cycle of the EditorJS instance, and exposes the underlying EditorJS instance.API - in future releases more of the API will be exposed via service methods to make controlling the container easier.\nLinks\n\nGitHub\nNPM\nAngular Demo\n\nTodo\n\n Add unit tests for all features (&#x1F614;)\n Improve documentation\n Provide better plugin support\n Provide enhancements for @ngrx/effects and other state management tools via pre-developed effects and services.\n Set up CD pipeline\n Provide more @Input on Directive/Component to make instance generation more configurable.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-readme/ngx-editorjs-changelog.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-readme/ngx-editorjs-changelog.html","title":"additional-page - ngx-editorjs Changelog","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog,\nand this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n[1.1.2] - 2019-05-11\nAdded\n\nImproved internal documentation for generated docs.\n\nRemoved\n\nGenerated docs no longer included in this module - all docs are now available via the generated docs site\n\n[1.1.1] - 2019-05-10\nAdded\n\nGenerated docs via CompoDoc in npm package\nInclude CHANGELOG.md in npm package\n\n[1.1.0] - 2019-05-10\nAdded\n\nEditorJS default paragraph plugin is now included in the default tools, fixes issue where the regenerated component failed to use the default plugin.\n\nChanged\n\nNgxEditorJSService is now provided in the root and now stores multiple editor instances. Getters removed and replaced with methods that take the holder parameter which is the ID of the DOM element the editor should be attached to.\nPlugins are now instances of an Injectable class for AOT and have an instance method of plugin. Also supports shortcut as an optional method that returns the string to set up as the shortcut.\nEditorJSPlugin now renamed BasePlugin and changed from class to interface.\nImproved documentation\n\n[1.0.0] - 2019-05-10\nAdded\n\nInitial release\nReadme, Changelog\nNgxEditorJSModule: That can be imported into the root of a project\nNgxEditorJSDirective: A directive that can attach an EditorJS instance to an element\nNgxEditorJSComponent: A component that is pre-configured to use the directive in any Angular project\nNgxEditorJSService: An Angular service for controlling an EditorJS instance\nDefault plugins for Header and List plugins, documentation on how to add plugins with AOT support\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-plugins-readme.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-plugins-readme.html","title":"additional-page - ngx-editorjs-plugins Readme","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNgx-EditorJS Plugins\nThis module provides a default set of EditorJS plugins for @tinynodes/ngx-editorjs via Angular modules and also provides the plugin service for registering and providing these plugins.\nPlugin Service\nThis package includes the NgxEditorJSPluginService which provides a singleton for registering\nEditorJS plugins with.\nPlugin List\n| Plugin Name             | Description                                            | EditorJS Plugin Link                             |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| PluginCodeModule        | Provides a  block editor                       | GitHub      |\n| PluginHeaderModule      | Provides a  -  block editor                  | GitHub    |\n| PluginImageModule       | Provides an  block editor + file upload support | GitHub     |\n| PluginLinkModule        | Provides an  block editor                         | GitHub      |\n| PluginIListModule       | Provides an / block editor                   | GitHub      |\n| PluginMarkerModule      | Provides inline text marking                           | GitHub    |\n| PluginParagraphModule   | Provides an  block editor                         | GitHub |\n| PluginSimpleImageModule | Provides an  block editor with paste support    | GitHub |\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-plugins-readme/ngx-editorjs-plugins-changelog.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/tinynodes-library-docs/ngx-editorjs-plugins-readme/ngx-editorjs-plugins-changelog.html","title":"additional-page - ngx-editorjs-plugins Changelog","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog,\nand this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n[1.0.0] - 2019-05-11\nAdded\n\nInitial release of module with default plugins - see README.md for details.\nMoved the internal PluginService to public NgxEditorJSPluginService provided by this module\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
